Hello, I'm Mohammed Ali Mistry, a C++ programmer currently working with Coding Saathi. I wanted to share some of the projects I have worked on during my internship.

Here is a list of my completed projects:

**1. Guessing Number Game**

Description:
The Guessing Number Game is an interactive console-based game where the user tries to guess the number generated by the computer within a certain range. The program provides feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low, guiding them to reach the correct number. The game continues until the user successfully guesses the number.

Features:
User-friendly interface with console-based input and output.
Random number generation for a unique experience in each game.
Interactive feedback to guide the user in making guesses.


**2. ATM Console Application****
